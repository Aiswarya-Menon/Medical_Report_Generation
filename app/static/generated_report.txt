Chest X-Ray Report
Patient Name: [Patient Name]
Patient ID: [Patient ID]
Date of Birth: [Date of Birth]
Date of Examination: [Date of Examination]
Referring Physician: [Referring Physician Name]
Reason for Examination: Suspected Pneumonia
Technique: PA and Lateral Chest Radiographs
Findings:

Consolidation:  A dense, homogenous opacity is observed in the [specify lobe, e.g., right lower lobe] consistent with consolidation.  This area demonstrates air bronchograms, further supporting the diagnosis of airspace disease.  The opacity extends to the [describe extent, e.g., periphery of the lung, pleural surface] and measures approximately [size, e.g., 6 x 8 cm].
Lung Volume: [Describe lung volumes, e.g., Lung volumes appear slightly reduced on the affected side.]
Pleural Effusion: [If present, describe size and location, e.g., A small pleural effusion is noted in the right costophrenic angle.]
Hilar Enlargement: [If present, describe which hilum and degree of enlargement, e.g., Mild right hilar enlargement is observed, possibly due to lymphadenopathy.]
Other: [Note any other findings, e.g.,  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.]

Impression:
The radiographic findings are consistent with a severe case of pneumonia, predominantly affecting the [specify lobe]. The presence of air bronchograms within the area of consolidation further supports this diagnosis. The extent of consolidation and [mention other findings supporting severity, e.g., presence of pleural effusion, reduced lung volume] indicate a severe presentation.
Correlation:
Clinical correlation is recommended, including consideration of the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.  Further investigation with [recommend additional investigations if needed, e.g.,  a CT scan of the chest] may be warranted to assess the extent of the disease and evaluate for complications.
Recommendations:

Treatment:  Given the severity of the pneumonia, prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended.  The choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and the patient's clinical status.
Oxygen Therapy: Supplemental oxygen should be provided if the patient is hypoxic.
Hospitalization:  Given the severity of the pneumonia, hospitalization is recommended for close monitoring and supportive care.
Follow-up Chest X-ray: A follow-up chest X-ray should be obtained in [specify timeframe, e.g., 4-6 weeks] to assess for resolution of the pneumonia and to exclude complications.
